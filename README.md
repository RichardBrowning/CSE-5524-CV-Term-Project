# CSE-5524-CV-Term-Project

## Introduction
This project aims to detect and track pedestrians and vehicles in gameplay videos of *Cyberpunk 2077* using classical computer vision algorithms, strictly avoiding neural networks. The system addresses key challenges including occlusion, appearance drift, scale variation, and diverse motion speeds through a multi-algorithm fusion approach.

## Pre-production

### Game Footage Capture
- Captured using OBS Studio at 1080p, 30 FPS with a capture card

- 15 clips (10-20 seconds each) featuring varied scenarios:
  - Dense pedestrian crowds (Jig-Jig Street)
  - High-speed vehicle chases (Badlands)
  - Mixed traffic (Corpo Plaza)
- Video specs: MP4 container, H.264 encoding, 1920×1080 resolution

### Environment Setup
- Dual-boot system: Ubuntu 22.04 (primary) / Windows 10 (fallback)
- Optimized dependency versions:
  ```text
  opencv-python==4.7.0.72
  numpy==1.24.3
  tqdm==4.65.0
  ```
- Setup commands:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv cv_env
  source cv_env/bin/activate
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Design and Implementation

### Core Architecture

#### Motion Detection Pipeline
1. **Dual-Mode Background Subtraction**
   - MOG2 with optimized parameters: `history=500`, `varThreshold=50`
   - Motion History Images (MHI) with dynamic decay (`τ=15`)

2. **Foreground Fusion**
   ```python
   combined_mask = cv2.bitwise_and(
       bg_subtractor.apply(frame),
       (mhi > 0).astype(np.uint8) * 255
   )
   ```

#### Multi-Object Tracking
- **Hybrid Tracker Features**:
  - KLT optical flow with adaptive feature selection:
    ```python
    cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack(
        roi, maxCorners=100,
        qualityLevel=0.03,
        minDistance=15,
        blockSize=15
    )
    ```
  - Mean-Shift with HSV histogram matching
  - Covariance-based appearance model

- **Target Classification**:
  ```python
  def classify_target(self):
      _, _, w, h = self.bbox
      aspect_ratio = w / max(h, 1)
      area = w * h
      
      if area < 5000: return "Noise"
      elif 5000 <= area < 20000 and 0.7 <= aspect_ratio <= 1.2:
          return "Pedestrian"
      elif area >= 20000 and aspect_ratio > 1.8:
          return "Vehicle"
  ```

### Key Optimizations
1. **ROI Processing**:
   - Only process bottom 80% of frame (road region)
   - Dynamic resolution scaling (1080p → 720p for processing)

2. **Failure Recovery**:
   - Adaptive re-initialization when tracking confidence < threshold
   - Kalman filtering for occlusion handling

## Execution

### Processing Pipeline
1. Place video clips in `data/input/`
2. Run with performance tuning:
   ```bash
   python main.py \
     --input data/input/traffic_scene.mp4 \
     --output data/results/ \
     --max-trackers 15 \
     --reinit-interval 10 \
     --scale 0.75
   ```
3. Runtime controls:
   - `Spacebar`: Pause/resume
   - `Q`: Quit processing
   - `S`: Save current frame

### Performance Metrics
| Scenario        | FPS  | ID Switches | MOTA |
|-----------------|------|-------------|------|
| Dense Crowd     | 18.2 | 7           | 0.72 |
| Highway Traffic | 22.1 | 3           | 0.85 |
| Night Scene     | 15.4 | 12          | 0.63 |

### Quantitative Evaluation
| Metric          | Value | Baseline |
|-----------------|-------|----------|
| Precision       | 0.82  | 0.68     |
| Recall          | 0.75  | 0.71     |
| IDF1            | 0.73  | 0.65     |
| Frame Rate      | 19.3  | 24.0     |

## Analysis

### Algorithm Trade-offs
1. **MHI vs. Optical Flow**
   - MHI better for sudden movements
   - Optical flow more precise for slow motions

2. **Parameter Sensitivity**
   - KLT window size critically affects performance:
     - Small windows (15×15): Better for pedestrians
     - Large windows (25×25): Better for vehicles

3. **Computation Budget**
   - 60% time spent on feature tracking
   - 25% on background subtraction
   - 15% on visualization

### Lessons Learned
1. **Color Spaces Matter**
   - HSV outperformed RGB for Mean-Shift in night scenes
   - YCrCb showed promise but added complexity

2. **Hardware Constraints**
   - OpenCV's CPU optimizations critical for real-time
   - Memory bottlenecks when processing >5 trackers

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates that classical computer vision algorithms can achieve reasonable tracking performance in complex game environments without deep learning. The hybrid approach combining motion, appearance, and temporal features achieved 73% IDF1 score while maintaining near-real-time performance.
