# CSE-5524-CV-Term-Project

## Introduction
This project aims to detect and track pedestrians and vehicles in gameplay videos of *Cyberpunk 2077* using classical computer vision algorithms, strictly avoiding neural networks. The system addresses key challenges including occlusion, appearance drift, scale variation, and diverse motion speeds through a multi-algorithm fusion approach.

## Pre-production

### Game Footage Capture
- Captured using OBS Studio at 1080p, 30 FPS with a capture card

- 15 clips (10-20 seconds each) featuring varied scenarios:
  - Dense pedestrian crowds (Jig-Jig Street)
  - High-speed vehicle chases (Badlands)
  - Mixed traffic (Corpo Plaza)
- Video specs: MP4 container, H.264 encoding, 1920Ã—1080 resolution

### Environment Setup
- Dual-boot system: Ubuntu 22.04 (primary) / Windows 10 (fallback)
- Optimized dependency versions:
  ```text
  opencv-python==4.7.0.72
  numpy==1.24.3
  tqdm==4.65.0
  ```
- Setup commands:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv cv_env
  source cv_env/bin/activate
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Design and Implementation



## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates that classical computer vision algorithms can achieve reasonable tracking performance in complex game environments without deep learning. The hybrid approach combining motion, appearance, and temporal features achieved 73% IDF1 score while maintaining near-real-time performance.

**Future Work**:
1. Implement covariance descriptor fusion
2. Add trajectory prediction
